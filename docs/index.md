# Episys Interface Overview

The Episys Interface is an OpCon environment that allows OpCon to run RSJ through a UNIX LSAM on the Episys server.

The current version is **21.00.0000**

Windows File Names
Some systems will not allow long file names (e.g., C:\Program Files\OpConxps\). To work around this, revert to method 8.3. In this method, the 7th character becomes a tilde followed by a 1 (e.g., C:\Progra~1\OpConxps\).
